# ApplePay configuration

Salesforce Commerce Cloud provides integration with Apple Pay on the Web, where Adyen is used as one of the payment facilitators to accept Apple Pay tokens and process them.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisite to use ApplePay via Adyen is to enable Apple Pay on your Adyen merchant account and Web Service User.

To do this you need to register an Apple Merchant ID on https://developer.apple.com/.
